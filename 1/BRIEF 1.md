I am sharing with you a folder for the upcoming project. This folder contains pdfs and code which you will need throughout the project.  
  
Here is a brief description of each file/folder:  
  
1.) removeBordersMasking: This is a previous project I did trying to convert the removeBorders algorithm into a CNN.  
2.) invoices.zip: This contains all the invoices we currently have.  
3.) ocr_config.txt: This file tells you for which invoices we are using the removeBorders algorithm  
4.) removeBorders.py: This contains the removeBorders algorithm.  
5.) tesserocr.ipynb: This shows you how to use TesseractOCR so you can see how well your algorithm performs.
